This app is a brutal twist on the 4 color game Simon. Currently a fully working game, it will be expanded to have "snags". To this effect, the reminder sequence has an increasing chance of things going wrong, whcih is designed to disrupt the various mechanisms that people use to remember. The audio cues not playing, or lights coming on, the board might rotate and even up to 4 more colors could enter the fray.

This is done through through the use of a React, SVGs and leaderboard is tracked in a database.
